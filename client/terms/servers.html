      agreed between us in writing, these Terms, together with our Privacy

      joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship. If we are
      prevented from or interfered with in any manner whatsoever, or otherwise
      delayed, in performing the Services or any other obligations hereunder, by
      reason of any event beyond our reasonable control, then our

      notice is given to you without delay, and our obligations hereunder will
      be extended by such reasonable amount of time determined by us in good
      faith. Any notice, report or other communication required or permitted to
      be given by us will be deemed to have been received if sent to your last
      known address or email address. These Terms may not be assigned by you. We
      may assign these Terms at any time and from time to time upon delivery of
      notice to you. These Terms will enure to the benefit of and be binding
